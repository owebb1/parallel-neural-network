    title = {MPI: A Message-Passing Interface Standard},
    year = {1994}, 
    publisher = {University of Tennessee}, address = {USA}, 
    abstract = {The Message Passing Interface Forum (MPIF), with participation from over 40 organizations, has been meeting since November 1992 to discuss and define a set of library standards for message passing. MPIF is not sanctioned or supported by any official standards organization. The goal of the Message Passing Interface, simply stated, is to develop a widely used standard for writing message-passing programs. As such the interface should establish a practical, portable, efficient and flexible standard for message passing. , This is the final report, Version 1.0, of the Message Passing Interface Forum. This document contains all the technical features proposed for the interface. This copy of the draft was processed by LATEX on April 21, 1994. , Please send comments on MPI to mpi-comments@cs.utk.edu. Your comment will be forwarded to MPIF committee members who will attempt to respond.}
