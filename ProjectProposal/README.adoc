= Project Proposal 

This directory contains a document that you should use for
writing your project proposal and annotated bibliography.

  * proposal.tex: latex source file, annotated with comments and can be built
           in either one or two column mode (see comment at top of file)

  * proposal.bib: contains bibtex entries.  entries from here are cited in 
              proposal.tex and all cited entries will be generated into a 
              References listing at the end of compiled paper.[pdf,ps,dvi].  
              see the Reference section at the bottom of proposal.tex for how 
              this is added. 

== to build

  * make:  build .pdf  (calls pdflatex and bibtex)
  * make clean:  clean up all built files

To view: use evince or acroread:
[source,sh]

acroread proposal.pdf

This is based on the paper.tex example from:
[source,sh]

  /home/newhall/public/latex_examples/paper/
----
The example in my `public` directory has more latex examples 
of figures, tables, math mode etc.  than the starting point
in your ProjectProposal subdirectory.  Take a look at the one 
above for latex syntax examples of these features.
